This document describes the materials, processes, outcomes and verifications required to successfully assemble and test a :math:`\constprojnumfull` :math:`\constprojtitle`, a sub-component of the Protonema electronics prototyping and learning system.

A first-time reader should carefully review section 2 - prerequisites, and section 3 - preparation before beginning the assembly process.

This document serves both as instructions and as a record of the assembly of the product. When you finish each step in this document, sign your name (or apply your stamp) in the "Signature/Stamp" box on the right to provide a record of completion.

When things go wrong, this document provides guidance for common issues that have been encountered in the past. When this document does not provide guidance, please contact your quality management representative, who will help you fill out an exception report. These reports help improve process quality and product quality, and these reports are incorporated into future revisions of this document.

Always remember: If you are unable to successfully complete these instructions, that means the processes supporting you (including this document) have failed you. Our processes are built for your success, and by improving our processes, we help everyone succeed.
