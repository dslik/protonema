## Project Overview
The Protonema Pi Pico board allows a Raspberry Pi microcontroller to be connected to protonema circuits.

Version 1.2 switches over to the standard [Pi Pico 3-pin debugging connectors](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/debug/debug-connector-specification.pdf). You can also order these boards with all SMT components pre-assembled from JLCPCB.

## Project Goals
* Provide a starting point for experimenting with and programming Pi Pico microcontrollers.

## Project Deliverables
* [Stamp PCB design](https://github.com/dslik/protonema/tree/main/stamps/1031A/1031-0102/latest)
* [Assembly documentation](https://dslik.github.io/protonema/stamps/1031A/1031-8010.pdf)
* [Sample software](https://github.com/dslik/protonema/tree/main/stamps/1031A/1031-9101)
