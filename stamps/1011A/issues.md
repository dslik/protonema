# Known Issues
## 1011-0101 v1.0
### 2022-10-10 Text alignment

The stamp name and part number text is reversed compared to the breadboard. The text should be moved over to the left side of the stamp, and rotated 180 degrees. This change is cosmetic and does not affect functionality.

Will fix in v1.1 or v2.0

### 2022-10-10 Missing QC date area on rear
Best practices are to include an area to write down the QC date.

Will fix in v1.1 or v2.0
