Protonema baseboards distribute power to stamps, and physically anchor them together.

Three baseboards are currently designed:

### 1510A Baseboard - 12 Stamps
The primary baseboard design is designed around a 8 1/2" by 11" paper size, which allows Protonema projects to be stored in a standard three-ring binder. It allows twelve 1x1 stamps to be attached. There is also a carrying handle, and a place for labels.

### 1532A Baseboard - 6 Stamps
This half-sized baseboard is more compact, and allows six 1x1 stamps to be attached.

### 1522A Baseboard - 4 Stamps
This mini baseboard allows four 1x1 stamps to be attached.
